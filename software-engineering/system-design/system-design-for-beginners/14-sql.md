# Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and SQL

## Overview

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are systems for storing and managing data using tables, with SQL (Structured Query Language) as the primary query language for accessing and manipulating data. This section focuses on the structure, functionality, and trade-offs of RDBMS, emphasizing their ACID properties and their role in system design. The notes cover data organization, indexing, constraints, transactions, and the benefits and limitations of RDBMS.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

- **Definition**: A system that organizes data into tables with rows (records) and columns (fields), using SQL for querying. Data is stored on disk for persistence.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Persistence**: Data on disk survives crashes, unlike in-memory systems (e.g., Redis).
  - **Efficiency**: Organized to enable fast reads/writes and querying.
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.

### 2. Data Structure: B+ Tree

- **Structure**:
  - A B+ tree is used to store and index data in RDBMS, optimized for disk-based storage.
  - Unlike binary trees (2 children per node), B+ trees are M-way trees, where each node has up to M children (e.g., M=3 for a 3-way tree).
  - Nodes have M-1 keys (e.g., M=3 means 2 keys per node).
  - **Non-Leaf Nodes**: Store keys to guide searches (no data).
  - **Leaf Nodes**: Store actual data in sorted order, linked like a linked list for range queries.
- **Properties**:
  - **Sorted Order**: Keys are sorted (e.g., 2, 5 in a node; values <2 go left, 2–5 go middle, >5 go right).
  - **Reduced Height**: More children per node reduce tree height, minimizing disk I/O.
  - **Range Queries**: Leaf nodes’ linked list structure enables efficient range searches (e.g., find all keys between 3 and 5).
- **Use Case**: A phone book index by name uses a B+ tree to quickly locate records (e.g., names starting with “B”).

### 3. Key Features of RDBMS

- **Tables**:
  - Data is stored in tables, each with a schema defining columns and data types.
  - Example: `CREATE TABLE people (phone_number INT, name VARCHAR(100));` creates a table with an integer phone number and a variable-length string name (up to 100 characters).
  - Rows represent records (e.g., Alice: 1234567890, Bob: 0987654321).
- **Indexes**:
  - A column (or set of columns) used to sort and search data efficiently, typically stored in a B+ tree.
  - Example: Indexing the `name` column in a phone book table enables fast alphabetical searches.
  - **Trade-Off**: Indexes speed up reads but slow down writes (due to index updates).
- **Constraints**:
  - **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row (e.g., `phone_number` ensures no duplicates).
  - **Foreign Key**: Links tables (e.g., `phone_number` in a `homes` table references `phone_number` in `people`).
  - **Not Null**: Ensures a column has a value (e.g., every person must have a name).
  - **Uniqueness**: Ensures unique values (e.g., no two people share a phone number).
- **Joins**:
  - Combine data from multiple tables based on a key.
  - Example: Join `people` and `homes` on `phone_number` to get names and addresses (e.g., `SELECT people.name, homes.address FROM people JOIN homes ON people.phone_number = homes.phone_number;`).

### 4. ACID Properties

RDBMS are designed to be ACID-compliant, ensuring reliable transactions. ACID stands for:

- **Atomicity**:
  - **Definition**: Transactions are all-or-nothing; either all operations complete, or none are applied.
  - **Example**: Transfer $500 from Alice ($1000 → $500) to Bob ($500 → $1000). If the database crashes after deducting from Alice but before adding to Bob, atomicity ensures no changes are committed (Alice stays at $1000, Bob at $500).
  - **Importance**: Prevents partial updates (e.g., money disappearing).
- **Consistency**:
  - **Definition**: Ensures the database remains in a valid state, adhering to constraints (e.g., foreign keys, not null).
  - **Example**: A foreign key constraint ensures every `phone_number` in `homes` exists in `people`. Updates violating this are rejected.
  - **Trade-Off**: Enforcing constraints (e.g., checking foreign keys) adds overhead, slowing writes.
- **Isolation**:
  - **Definition**: Transactions appear to execute serially, even if concurrent, preventing side effects like dirty reads.
  - **Dirty Read Example**: Transaction 1 deducts $500 from Alice ($1000 → $500). Transaction 2 reads $500 and adds $200 ($500 → $700), committing. If Transaction 1 fails, Transaction 2’s $700 is invalid (based on uncommitted data). Isolation prevents this by ensuring Transaction 2 reads the original $1000.
  - **Importance**: Avoids inconsistent states during concurrent transactions.
- **Durability**:
  - **Definition**: Committed transactions are permanently stored on disk, surviving crashes.
  - **Example**: After committing a $500 transfer, the database ensures the change is saved, even if it crashes immediately after.
  - **Trade-Off**: Disk writes are slower than in-memory writes (e.g., Redis).

### 5. Transactions

- **Definition**: A sequence of SQL operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) executed as a single unit.
- **Process**:
  - Begins with `BEGIN` statement.
  - Executes queries (e.g., insert a record, update another).
  - Ends with `COMMIT` to save changes or `ROLLBACK` to undo if it fails.
- **Example**: `BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE name = 'Alice'; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE name = 'Bob'; COMMIT;`
- **ACID Role**: Transactions ensure atomicity (all or nothing), consistency (valid state), isolation (no interference), and durability (persisted changes).

### 6. System Design Trade-Offs

- **Advantages of RDBMS**:
  - **Reliability**: ACID properties ensure data integrity (e.g., no money lost in bank transfers).
  - **Structured Data**: Tables with schemas enforce data consistency and relationships (e.g., foreign keys).
  - **Powerful Queries**: Joins and SQL enable complex data retrieval (e.g., combining `people` and `homes`).
  - **Fast Reads**: B+ tree indexes optimize searches and range queries.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Performance**: Disk-based storage is slower than in-memory systems (e.g., Redis). Constraint checks (e.g., foreign keys) add write overhead.
  - **Scalability**: Vertical scaling (bigger hardware) is limited; horizontal scaling (sharding) is complex due to joins and constraints.
  - **Schema Rigidity**: Fixed schemas require predefined structure, less flexible for dynamic data.
- **Comparison with NoSQL**:
  - RDBMS: Best for structured data with strong consistency (e.g., banking systems).
  - NoSQL: Better for unstructured data, high scalability, and flexibility (e.g., social media feeds), but often sacrifices ACID properties.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Twitter: RDBMS for user profiles (structured, with foreign key constraints) but NoSQL for tweets (high write volume, flexible schema).

### 7. System Design Relevance

- **When to Use RDBMS**:
  - Applications requiring strong consistency (e.g., financial systems, inventory management).
  - Structured data with relationships (e.g., user profiles linked to addresses).
  - Complex queries with joins (e.g., reporting systems).
- **When to Avoid**:
  - High write throughput or unstructured data (e.g., real-time analytics, social media feeds).
  - Horizontal scaling needs (NoSQL databases like MongoDB are easier to shard).
- **Interview Tips**:
  - Justify RDBMS for ACID compliance in critical systems (e.g., bank transactions).
  - Discuss scaling challenges (e.g., sharding, replication) and alternatives (e.g., NoSQL).
  - Highlight indexing for performance and constraints for data integrity.

## Key Takeaways

- **RDBMS**: Stores data on disk in tables, using B+ trees for efficient indexing and querying.
- **SQL**: Query language for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in RDBMS.
- **B+ Tree**: M-way tree with sorted keys, storing data in leaf nodes for fast searches and range queries.
