# High-Level Application Architecture for a Production App

## Overview

The architecture of a production-grade application involves multiple components that work together to deliver functionality to users while ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Below is a high-level overview from a developer’s perspective, focusing on how code is deployed, how servers handle user requests, and how supporting services like storage, logging, metrics, and alerting contribute to the system.

## Key Components of Application Architecture

1. **Code Development and Deployment**

   - **Developer’s Role**: Developers write code that needs to be deployed to a server to run.
   - **Deployment Process**:
     - Code is built and deployed, often using a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** server for automation, though it can be done on a developer’s local machine.
     - CI/CD is common in professional settings for production-grade applications.
   - **Server**: A computer that handles user requests and runs the deployed code.

2. **Server**

   - **Definition**: A server is a computer designed to process requests and serve users.
   - **Functionality**:
     - **Frontend Server**: Delivers JavaScript/HTML code to a user’s browser to load a webpage.
     - **Backend Server**: Responds to API requests (e.g., from a browser) with data, often in **JSON** format.
   - **Limitations**: A single server may struggle to handle many simultaneous user requests due to hardware constraints (e.g., CPU, RAM, or disk).

3. **Scaling Strategies**

   - **Vertical Scaling**:
     - Involves upgrading a single server’s hardware (e.g., adding a faster CPU, more RAM, or larger disk).
     - Simple but limited by hardware constraints (computers cannot scale infinitely).
   - **Horizontal Scaling**:
     - Involves adding more servers to distribute the workload.
     - Multiple servers run the same code, allowing the system to handle more user requests concurrently.
     - **Challenge**: Determining which server handles each user request.
     - **Solution**: A **load balancer** distributes requests across servers to ensure balanced traffic, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed.

4. **Storage**

   - **Purpose**: Stores persistent data for the application.
   - **Types**:
     - **Database**: A common choice for structured data storage.
     - **Other Mechanisms**: Various distributed storage systems (e.g., cloud storage, file systems).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Typically runs on a separate computer, connected to the server via a network.
     - Can be located in different parts of the world, unlike a server’s local disk, which has capacity and performance limitations.

5. **External Services**

   - **Purpose**: Servers may communicate with external APIs (e.g., Stripe for payments) to provide additional functionality.
   - **Network Dependency**: These services are often hosted on separate systems, requiring network communication.

6. **Logging**

   - **Purpose**: Tracks application activity (e.g., user requests, errors) for debugging and monitoring.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Logs are stored in an **external logging service** rather than the server to avoid resource constraints.
     - Developers access logs to understand application behavior and diagnose issues.
   - **User Interaction**: Users do not interact with logs; they are for developer use.

7. **Metrics**

   - **Purpose**: Provide insights into server performance and resource usage (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk usage, request success/failure rates).
   - **Types**:
     - **Resource Metrics**: Monitor hardware usage (e.g., CPU or RAM load).
     - **Application Metrics**: Track application performance (e.g., successful/failed requests).
     - **Log-Based Metrics**: Derived from logs, often displayed as time-series charts to show trends over time.
   - **Importance**: Metrics help developers understand system health and identify bottlenecks.

8. **Alerting**
   - **Purpose**: Notifies developers immediately when issues arise (e.g., when a metric crosses a threshold, like request success rate dropping below 95%).
   - **Functionality**:
     - Metrics feed into an **alerting service** that sends push notifications to developers.
     - Prevents reliance on manual checks or user complaints to detect issues.
   - **Example**: Alerts trigger when performance metrics deviate from expected norms, enabling quick response to problems.

## Networking Considerations

- **Role**: Enables communication between components (e.g., servers, storage, external services) that may run on different computers, often in different locations.
- **Complexity**: Networking is critical but complex; developers need a basic understanding to design scalable applications effectively.

## Key Takeaways

- **Application Goal**: Deliver reliable, scalable services to users while providing developers with tools to monitor and maintain the system.
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling improves a single server, while horizontal scaling adds more servers with load balancing for better performance.
- **Supporting Services**: Logging, metrics, and alerting are critical for monitoring and maintaining application health.
- **Distributed Nature**: Components like storage and external services often run on separate systems, connected via networks, making the architecture distributed.

# Questions for Review

1. What is the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling, and why might horizontal scaling be preferred for handling a large number of user requests?
2. How does a load balancer contribute to the performance of a horizontally scaled application?
3. What is the role of a CI/CD server in the deployment process, and why is it commonly used in production-grade applications?
4. Why is it beneficial to store logs in an external logging service rather than on the application server itself?
5. How do metrics and alerting services work together to help developers maintain a production application, and why is this better than relying on user feedback?
